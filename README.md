# Core Values 
  
 ## Respect 
  
 Respect for yourself and others. Everyone deserves to be respected; give them a chance. Try not to fault people for things they did in the past. You likely don't know all the circumstances that led to those decisions. 
  
 Some examples of disrespect: 
  
 - Speaking ill of a former teammate for decisions they made. 
 - Blaming someone for creating a problem instead of taking the opportunity to help find a solution and provide a learning experience.

 ## Maintain a Growth Mindset 
  
 In everything, there is the potential to learn and grow. Sometimes it's learning a new engineering technique, sometimes it's simply making a small improvement to an algorithm. 
  
 - Not everything requires a complete redo. 
 - What can you do to make an improvement today? 
 - What's the very next step? 
 - If you're (or the subject at hand) not better than you were three months ago, why not? 
  
 One caveat: 
  
 > Do not use a new technology without proper justification and agreement from the team! 
  
 Try out a new motto: **Be inquisitive!**

 ## Do Quality Work 
  
 There is some overlap between this and **Maintaining a Growth Mindset**. 
  
 Shipping code quickly is useless if it doesn't work, causes confusion for the customer, or will be impossible to expand upon and improve in a future iteration. This however is not a free pass to spend an infinite amount of time on a feature. 
  
 Goals: 
  
 - Provide customers with a product that is of professional quality. 
 - Produce work you're proud of. 
 - Fix things 
   - If it can be fixed quickly, do it now. If not, follow up on it later.

 ## Be a Team Player 
  
 We are all part of a team. Be there for your teammates when they have questions or are struggling with a problem. 
  
 Remember that: 
  
 - There is no such thing as a stupid question.

 ## Celebrate Victories 
  
 It's easy to let victories go unacknowledged with the way we work today. Take a pause and recognize them. It doesn't have to be elaborate but it can mean so much for the people involved, even you. 
  
 Taking the time to acknowledge successes also helps with team bonding.
